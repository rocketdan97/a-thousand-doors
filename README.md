# a-thousand-doors

A thousand people line up in front of a thousand doors. The first person opens every door, the second person closes every other door, and the third person goes to every third door and changes its state (i.e., opens it if it’s closed and closes it if it’s open). Then the fourth person changes the state of every fourth door, the fifth person changes the state of every fifth door, and so on for all one thousand people. 

How many doors are open once this is all finished?
